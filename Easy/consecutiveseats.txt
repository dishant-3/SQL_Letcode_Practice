-- Question 37
-- Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
-- Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
-- | seat_id | free |
-- |---------|------|
-- | 1       | 1    |
-- | 2       | 0    |
-- | 3       | 1    |
-- | 4       | 1    |
-- | 5       | 1    |
 

-- Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

-- | seat_id |
-- |---------|
-- | 3       |
-- | 4       |
-- | 5       |
-- Note:
-- The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
-- Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

-- Solution
select distinct seat_id
from 
cinema as a
inner join 
cinema as b
on abs(a.seat_id - bseat_id )=1
where a.free =1 and b.free =1
order by seat_id;

-- Using lead and lag

select seat_id
from
(
    select seat_id, free, lead(free,1,3) over(order by seat_id) as next,
    lag(free,1,3) over (order by seat_id) as prev 
    from cinema
) as tb1
where tb1.free =1 and (tb1.prev=1 or tb1.next=1);
